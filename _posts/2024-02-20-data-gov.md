<p class="intro"><span class="dropcap">I</span>n the technology-driven world we live in, data has become integral to nearly everything we do- from business growth to healthcare innovation to our own personal decision making. We are constantly creating, sharing, and consuming data. With the vast amount of data that is available to all, it is important to understand how to properly utilize and understand this data. This is where data governance comes in. </p>

### WHO needs Data Governance?

Before we go into details on what data governance is, lets talk about why it matters for you. I know for me, when I first heard the words "data governance" I immediately lost interest and assumed that it was a tedious concept that I didn't need to be involved in or understand. Little did I know how important data governance really is- Data governance will take us into the future. 

To answer the question of who needs data governance, just look around you. Data is everywhere around us, and if we want to use that data to improve any aspect of our life, data governance is crucial. Businesses and corporations can rely on data governance to ensure the quality and integrity of their data. Healthcare organizations need data governance in regards to sensitive information and research. The government can use data governance to make certain of transparency and accountability. Data governance also finds its way into the world of finance, education, and technology.

One of the best parts about data governance is that it is a one size fits all solution. It is not just useful for big corporations but an essential asset for any who are dealing with data. 

Data Governance has become useful in businesses of all sizes, helping them handle and maintain the vast amounts of data they have coming in and utilizing it in the best ways for their companies. The key to becoming a successful business in the world we live in is to be data-centric. The key to successfully focusing on and utilizing data is learning how to use data governance. 

### WHAT is Data Governance?

Now that you understand who needs data governance, it's important to understand what it really is.

Picture an enormous library filled with millions of books. Each book on the shelves represents a piece of data, and the library itself represents the collective knowledge and data of our society. In the library, the librarian organizes the books, ensuring they are maintained and stored in the correct places. They also enforce the rules for what books can be checked out and when books are borrowed or returned.

Data governance is the librarian overseeing and maintaning this library of information. Effective data governance gives us a structured organization that will help us utilize the data that is available to us and be able to trust in its reliability.

## The Process
According to Spiceworks, data governance can be defined as follows:

<blockquote style = "font-size: 20px">“The collection of data management processes and procedures that help an organization manage its internal and external data flows. It aligns people, processes, and technology, to help them understand data to transform it into an enterprise asset”</blockquote>

If you want to read more from Spiceworks, you can access the article <a href="https://www.spiceworks.com/tech/big-data/articles/what-is-data-governance-definition-importance-and-best-practices/#_001" target="_blank">Here</a>

As this definition emphasizes, there are many different facets of data governance and it can take on many forms- from data modeling to warehousing to security. The different parts of data governance include data processes that track the quality of the data, policies that state expectations of the data, and standards and rules that ensure the data policy is being followed.

### HOW Does Data Governance Work?

Now that we know the Who and the What behind data governance, we can better understand how it works and how it is implemented. The first steps to data governance are the same as the same as the first steps in constructing a building: You need to establish a framework.

#### The Framework

Now Data governance framework is quite similar to the framework used in construction. Just like how framework in construction gives you a solid outline to start building from, data governance framework gives you an organizational structure and helps break up the different roles, responsibilities, and procedures of data governance. 

According to <a href="https://www.techrepublic.com/article/data-governance-framework/" target="_blank">Tech Republic</a>, there are 4 key pillars of data governance: <strong>Data Quality</strong>- ensuring data is clean and reliable- <strong>Data integration</strong>- merging data to make it more effective for analysis- <strong>Data Privacy and Security</strong>- implementing policies and procedures to comply with data laws- and <strong>Data Architecture</strong>- designing and structuring data systems and data warehouses. 

With this framework in place, you can define individual's roles and start learning how important and essential data governance really is. 

### WHY Data Governance?

We've covered our bases with data governance, but it's important to understand WHY. As I mentioned earlier, we live in a world that is increasingly more digital and technology driven. The more data we have access to, the more we need to make sure that it is governed and secure. In order to get as much out of data as we possibly can, it is essential to use best practices and make sure our data is maintained and looked after. That is why data governance is so important. 

My call to action for you? Look into data governance. Ask questions and become an expert. The future is in data, and the companies and businesses that are going to succeed are those who have teams and employees who understand data governance and can use it effectively. Don't be behind the curve.
