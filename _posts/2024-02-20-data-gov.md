<p class="intro"><span class="dropcap">I</span>n the technology-driven world we live in, data has become integral to nearly everything we do- from business growth to healthcare innovation to our own personal decision making. We are constantly creating, sharing, and consuming data. With the vast amount of data that is available to all, it is important to understand how to properly utilize and understand this data. This is where data governance comes in. </p>

### WHO needs Data Governance?

I know for me, when I first heard the words "data governance" I immediately lost interest and assumed that it was a tedious concept that I didn't need to be involved in or understand. Little did I know how important data governance really is. 

To answer the question of who needs data governance, just look around you. Data is everywhere around us, and if we want to use that data to improve any aspect of our life, data governance is crucial. Businesses and corporations can rely on data governance to ensure the quality and integrity of their data. Healthcare organizations need data governance in regards to sensitive information and research. The government can use data governance to make certain of transparency and accountability. Data governance also finds its way into the world of finance, education, and technology.

One of the best parts about data governance is that it is a one size fits all solution. It is not just useful for big corporations but an essential asset for any who are dealing with data. 





Picture an enormous library filled with millions of books. Each book on the shelves represents a piece of data, and the library itself represents the collective knowledge and data of our society. In the library, the librarian organizes the books, ensuring they are maintained and stored in the correct places. They also enforce the rules for what books can be checked out and when books are borrowed or returned.

Data governance is the librarian overseeing and maintaning this library of information. Effective data governance gives us a structured organization that will help us utilize the data that is available to us and be able to trust in its reliability.
