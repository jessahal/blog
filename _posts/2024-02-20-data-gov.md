In the technology-driven world we live in, data has become integral to nearly everything we do- from business growth to healthcare innovation to our own personal decision making. We are constantly creating, sharing, and consuming data. With the vast amount of data that is available to all, it is important to understand how to properly utilize and understand this data. This is where data governance comes in. 

I know for me, when I first heard the words "data governance" I immediately lost interest and assumed that it was a tedious concept that I didn't understand. 

Picture an enormous library filled with millions of books. Each book on the shelves represents a piece of data, and the library itself represents the collective knowledge and data of our society. In the library, the librarian organizes the books, ensuring they are maintained and stored in the correct places. They also enforce the rules for what books can be checked out and when books are borrowed or returned.

Data governance is the librarian overseeing and maintaning this library of information. Effective data governance gives us a structured organization that will help us utilize the data that is available to us and be able to trust in its reliability.
