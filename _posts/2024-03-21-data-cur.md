<p class="intro"><span class="dropcap">D</span>ata is in EVERYTHING. Every action we take creates new data, and learning how to harness this data can help us better understand the world around us. In this post, I'll take you through a quick walkthrough on using APIs and Data curation using some of the quickest data I could find- Formula 1 Racing data.

I absolutely love F1 racing. I love the fast cars, intense races, team dynamics, and the drivers. In F1, there are so many elements that go into a good race and driver's performance. Throughout this post, I'll show you how to use <a href = 'https://ergast.com/mrd/' target ="_blank">Ergast's open F1 API</a> to create a custom data set with stats on one of the best drivers in Formula 1 history: Lewis Hamilton. The best part? I'll explain what we're doing step by step, making it easy for you to customize which driver or which stats YOU want. 

Our data set can help us see trends in the racing patterns/wins of specific drivers (in my data frame's case, Lewis Hamilton). In another post we'll go into more detail about what we can do with this data and explore further what insights we can gain.

### Good API/Data Scraping Practice

Before we begin our API/data scraping process to get our F1 data set, let's talk about some best practices. 

When using API keys, there are rules and pratices you'll want to follow to ensure you are using the data in ethical and allowable ways and following the guidelines set up by the owners. For our F1 data set, Ergast is a free and open API that does not require an API key. When you are finding your own APIs, make sure to pay close attention to the guidelines set up by the system owners. 

On the <a href = 'https://ergast.com/mrd/terms/' target ="_blank">Terms and Conditions Page</a> of Ergast's website, they go through some of their policies on their API. Their data is free for anyone to use, but cannot be used in an application or service that is going to charge. They have some responsible use guidelines directing users to good practices. Whenever you are using an API, make sure to check out their documentation and terms and conditions to make sure you comply with their guildelines. 

## Data Collection
### Tools and Packages

In Python, I used Pandas, Numpy, and the Requests packages in my data curation. I also imported Matplotlib and Seaborn to give a sneak peak at our EDA, which will be shown in the next post. 

### Step 1: Find Your Endpoints

Our <a href = 'https://ergast.com/mrd/' target ="_blank">Ergast F1 API</a> takes us to their main webpage showing the documentation of the API and how to navigate through it. 

Using APIs requires a GET request (using the requests package) using a URL where you specify what exactly you want to pull from the API. In our case, our URL would look like the following:

{%- highlight python -%}
f1_base = "https://ergast.com/api/f1"
# This code, when added to the f1_base api, lets us choose which driver
# Before adding results, we retrieve information on Hamilton directly. 
hamilton = '/drivers/hamilton/results.json'
# Adding /results returns the results and stats on Hamilton's races

# Limit lets us choose how much data we want our api to return
params = {'limit': 500}

# Combine the Base URL and our Racer's specifics
ham_url = f1_base + hamilton
{%- endhighlight python -%}

To get information on a different driver, you would replace "/hamilton/" with "/{your driver}/" and as explained in the code chunk above, adding "/results" is what returns the specific results of our driver. Otherwise, our URL returns biographical details. 

- Params = {'limit': 500} is the parameter that tells our URL how many rows of data to return. Since Lewis Hamilton has raced in hundreds of races over the years, our parameter had to be set at a larger number. 

### Step 2: Using our Requests package and filtering to our data set

Now that we have our URL, we can use the Requests package and command <strong>requests.get(URL, PARAMS)</strong> to start using Ergast's API to grab our data. We'll then run a quick check to make sure our url worked, and then use <strong>.json()</strong> to convert the results from a JSON file to a Python dictionary that we can access and manipulate easier.

{%- highlight python -%}
r = requests.get(ham_url, params = params)
if r.ok:
    ham_stats = r.json()
{%- endhighlight python -%}

At this point, we have our data but it is nested inside many different lists and dictionaries. The code below is what allows us to create a coherent data set from our retrieved files, digging in and extracting the exact data that we want.

Notes are included in the code chunk below to walk through what the various steps are doing.

{%- highlight python -%}
# ham_stats['MRData']['RaceTable']['Races'] works through different tables/steps to get us to the right information
    ham_stats2 = ham_stats['MRData']['RaceTable']['Races']
    # The loop below gathers data from each race and adds it to lists which will be converted into our df
    for i in range(0, len(ham_stats2)):
        seasons = ham_stats2[i]
        race_stats = seasons['Results'][0]

        ham_list = {'Date': pd.to_datetime(seasons['date']),
                    'Season': seasons['season'],
                    'Race': seasons['raceName'],
                    'Team': race_stats['Constructor']['name'],
                    'Position': int(race_stats['position']),
                    'Starting Grid Position': int(race_stats['grid']),
                    'Time': race_stats['Time']['time'] if ('Time' in race_stats and 'time' in race_stats['Time']) else 'NA', # Time is filled in as NA if not recorded- Represents a non-finished race
                    'Avg Speed': float(race_stats['FastestLap']['AverageSpeed']['speed']) if ('FastestLap' in race_stats and 'AverageSpeed' in race_stats['FastestLap'] and 'speed' in race_stats['FastestLap']['AverageSpeed']) else 0} 
        # Avg Speed is marked as NA if there was not an average speed recorded for that race
        ham_data.append(ham_list)
    ham_df = pd.DataFrame(ham_data)
    # Replacing 'Grand Prix' with "GP" for simplicity :)
    ham_df['Race'] = ham_df['Race'].replace(' Grand Prix', ' GP', regex=True)
    ham_df.to_csv('hamilton_stats.csv', index = False)
{%- endhighlight python -%}

As you can see, this API was a little complex to dive into, but once we're in it's quite easy to pick the variables and stats that we want to see. 

I figured out where the specific data I wanted was using <a href = 'https://ergast.com/mrd/methods/results/' target ="_blank">Ergast's guidelines for /results</a>, where they walk through how to filter your results down. 

I chose specific variables that interested me and that I want to use in my EDA, but you can narrow/widen these results to the variables you would like to include.

After that, we've got our data set!

The table above is the first 5 and last 5 rows in our data set, representing Hamilton's first 5 F1 races and his most recent 5. Our total data set has 335 rows, which is the total number of races Hamilton has raced in F1.

One of the best parts about using APIs is you have a fully customizable data set at your fingertips. You get to decide which variables you want to include/exclude. You get to modify your data sets depending on the focuses you want to put. There's a freedom in knowing how to use APIs, and hopefully this blog post brought you one step closer!

### What's Next?

Generating a data set was great, but it's not going to mean anything if we don't do anything with it. We know how to get our data, the next steps are learning from it and discovering what the data can teach us. Stay tuned for the next post where we begin some exploratory data analysis and gain a little more insight into what makes Lewis Hamilton a great race driver and how his racing has changed over the years!
