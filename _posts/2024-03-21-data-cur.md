<p class="intro"><span class="dropcap">D</span>ata is in EVERYTHING. Every action we take creates new data, and learning how to harness this data can help us better understand the world around us. In this post, I'll take you through a quick walkthrough of API webscraping and Data curation using some of the quickest data I could find- Formula 1 Racing data.

I recently have fallen in love with F1 racing. I love the fast cars, the team dynamics, and the drivers. In F1, there are so many elements that go into a good race and driver's performance. I this post, I'll show you how to use Ergt's open F1 API to create a custom data set with stats on one of the best drivers in Formula 1 history: Lewis Hamilton. </p>
